## Best Practices

1. **Take notes in real-time** during meetings
2. **Assign action items** with clear owners and due dates
3. **Document decisions** that affect architecture (create ADRs)
4. **Share notes** within 24 hours of meeting
5. **Review action items** at start of next meeting
6. **Keep it concise** - focus on decisions and action items

## Meeting Types
